In an attempt to detect long-transient wave signals produced by newly born magnetars in the time-frequency domain, we use PyTorch to train a convolutional neural network that is able to detect these signals. For our training data, a simulation is made to project randomly generated signals onto a square matrix of both Gaussian noise and noise generated using data from LIGO's sensitivity curve in 2023. This simulated data is then used to train and test a convolutional neural network with user variable signal strength.

A set of hyperparameters were not found that could train a model to find signals at an accurate strength relative to the noise. Progress was still being made at the end of the project timeline, however. It is inconclusive as to whether a set of hyperparameters exist. With more training and a good hyperparameter optimization algorithm, finding one very well might be possible. algorithm, finding one very well might be possible.
