In an attempt to detect long-transient wave signals produced by newly born magnetars in the time-frequency domain, we use PyTorch to train a convolutional neural network that is able to detect these signals. For our training data, a simulation is made to project randomly generated signals onto a square matrix of both Gaussian noise and noise generated using data from LIGO's sensitivity curve in 2023. This simulated data is then used to train and test a very basic convolutional neural network with user variable signal strength.

A set of hyperparameters were not found that could train a model to find signals at an accurate strength relative to the noise, although progress was still being made at the end of the project timeline. It is inconclusive as to whether a set of hyperparameters exist, however it may be possible to find one with more training and a good hyperparameter optimization algorithm.
